# viviscrobbler

## why?
two reasons.
1. no scrobbler exists that is exactly perfect for my use-case.
2. i wanted to learn go.

## installation:
either use the compiled release files or clone the repo and build it yourself.

### building from source:
to build from source run the following commands in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/violetcircus/viviscrobbler
cd viviscrobbler
go build
```
this will create the viviscrobbler executable.
